## Welcome to Clever Game

## Description
Clever Game is a digital recreation of a dice game called Ganz Schon or That's So Clever. The object of the game is fairly simple. The player or players each take turns rolling six different colored die and then using deciding which are the best one's to take to use on their score card and which to leave behind for the other players to use on theirs. On a scoring card there are different colored fields and each of them have their own set of rules. The color of the die corresponds to the color of the field. 

## Rules of the Game
* Each player get's three rounds per turn.
* Roll all six dice
* Select which dice you would like to keep and which you would like to leave in the left over pile
* If you select a dice that has a higher number than another dice then the lower numbered dice or die go into the left over pile. So if you roll a 6,5,4,3,2, and 1 and decide to keep the 6 then the remaining 5 dice go into the left over pile and you only get to keep the 6. If you were to take the 4 then only the 3, 2, and 1 die would go to the left over pile and you would then roll the 6 and 5 die again for the next round of your turn. 
* Each time you select a dice to keep you must decide where it will go. Some fields work in ascending order and so your only option is to place the die that you kept and who's color corresponds to that field in the next availble spot. 
  * The fields:
  * Yellow Field: The yellow field has pre-determined spots that are marked off already for the player(s). Kind of like bingo. The only way to score points in the yellow field is to complete a column. The first column is worth 10 points, the second column is worth 14 points, the third column is worth 16 points, and the fourth column is worht 20 points. 
  * Blue Field: The blue field has a requirement to have the blue dice and the white dice be played together. So if you roll a white 3 and a blue 4 then the square that you are allowed to take in the blue is 7. This can get confusing only because the white dice is also a wild dice for the rest of the fields but it is not a wild in the blue field. So if you were to roll a white 6 you cannot take the number 6 square in the blue field. You must combine the white dice with the blue dice. Scoring in the blue field works as such that the more squares you take in the blue field the higher score is for the entirety of the blue field. If you mark off all 11 squares in the blue field then your total blue field score is 56.  
  * Green Field: The green field works in ascending order where each square has a requirment where the number that you choose from the green die has to be greater than or equal to the number of the square where you would like to place. So if you want to place a green dice in the 4th square then your green dice has to be a 4 or higher. Scoring in the green field works similar to the blue field where the more squares you get the higher your number. If you get all 11 squares then your green field score will be 66. 
  * Orange Field: The orange field works in ascending order but you can place whatever number you want in each square. Some squares will double or triple the number of your dice that you are placing in that square. The scoring for the orange field work such that the sum of all the numbers in the orange field is your orange fields score. 
  * Purple Field. The purple field works in ascending order but with one rule. Like the orange field you can place whatever number you would like in each square so long as the number you are placing is greater than the number in the previous square. The scoring for the purple field works such that the sum of all the numbers in the purple field is the purple fields score. 

## About this project
This digital version of this game was an effort to increase my skills as a coder. I graduated from a coding bootcamp in 2020 and wanted to improve my skills especially with React. I had heard multiple career advisers suggest that I should build a game as it will help improve your algorithm skills and logical thinking. This project has certainly done both for me. As a bonus I really love this game and am excited to now have a working digital copy of it that I can play.
