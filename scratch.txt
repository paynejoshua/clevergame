To Do:
[] Keep track of how many times the player has rolled the dice. 
    [] If 3 then move remaining dice in available field to left over field
[] Create score tracking element
[] If blue dice is selected then add up number of white dice as well
[] Create a way to track who's turn it is for up to 3 players
[] Create a way to track which round it is
    [] Rounds are determined by amount of players
[] Create a way to track special powers for each player (foxes, +1's, roll again, double points, triple points,
    wild cards for each color, round special powers)
[] Create an animation for dice rolling

Finished:

[x] Have 6 dice that get mapped over and generate a random number between 1 & 6 for each
[x] Create a conditional statement that doesn't allow the player to roll the dice again
until they have selected which ones they want
[x] Only roll the dice that haven't been selected
